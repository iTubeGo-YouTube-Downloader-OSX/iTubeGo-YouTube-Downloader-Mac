## Overview

<a href="#">Planner 5D</a> makes home design accessible to everyone through an intuitive interface that requires no architectural or design training. Create floor plans by drawing walls, add doors and windows where needed, furnish rooms from extensive catalogs, and visualize results in photorealistic 3D - all within a single application.

The <a href="#">2D floor plan</a> mode provides the foundation for design work. Draw walls by clicking and dragging. Specify exact dimensions for precision. Add doors and windows that create proper openings. Partition spaces into rooms with automatic area calculation. This 2D workspace establishes the spatial framework for your design.

<a href="#">3D visualization</a> transforms floor plans into explorable environments. Switch to 3D view and walk through your design. See how rooms feel at actual scale. Check sight lines and traffic flow. Visualize furniture arrangements before purchasing. This 3D capability makes design decisions tangible rather than abstract.

The <a href="#">furniture catalog</a> provides thousands of items for furnishing spaces. Sofas, tables, beds, appliances - browse categories or search for specific items. Drag furniture into rooms and position precisely. Resize items to match real-world dimensions. This extensive catalog eliminates the need to model furniture yourself.

<a href="#">Material customization</a> tailors surfaces to your preferences. Change wall colors instantly. Apply different flooring materials to compare options. Adjust countertop materials in kitchens. Update fabric textures on furniture. This customization enables exploring finish options before committing.

The <a href="#">lighting system</a> affects how spaces appear realistically. Natural light enters through windows based on placement and size. Add artificial lighting fixtures from the catalog. Adjust light intensity and color temperature. See how lighting choices affect room ambiance.

<a href="#">Snapshots</a> capture design views as images. Set up camera angles showing rooms at their best. Render high-resolution images for sharing or printing. Create multiple views capturing different aspects of the design. These snapshots communicate designs to others effectively.
